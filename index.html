      <h1>Welcome to WaterCalc</h1>
      <p>WaterCalc is a digital simulation inspired by research and innovation at the University of Arizona in Tucson — a leading institution in water sustainability and desert ecology.</p>
      <p>Located in the heart of the Sonoran Desert, the University of Arizona is a global leader in water conservation, hydrology, and climate resilience. Its scientists and students work on cutting-edge solutions to ensure clean water access in arid regions.</p>
      <p>This simulation reflects the journey of water from collection to purification, echoing the real-world technologies developed in Tucson — from rainwater harvesting to advanced filtration systems.</p>
      <p>WaterCalc invites you to explore the challenges of water scarcity and the importance of sustainable practices. It’s a tribute to the resilience of desert communities and the pioneering spirit of Arizona researchers.</p>
      <p>Whether you're a student, educator, or curious explorer, we hope this experience deepens your appreciation for water as a vital resource and sparks interest in the science behind its preservation.</p>
